# Building Docs

This page provides instructions for building and rendering the Fig-Tree documentation.
Project documentation is built using the [Mkdocs Material](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/) framework.
For detailed instructions on Mkdocs, we point readers to the official documentation.

## Preliminary Setup

Building the documentation requires extra dependencies beyond what is required by the core application.
These can be installed using the following command:

```bash
poetry install --with docs
```

## Common Use Cases

### Rendering a Live Preview

The `serve` command will build are serve a live version f the documentation website on your local machine.
The live documentation preview will automatically reload to reflect most changes made to the documentation source files.
However, some documentation is generated by pulling information directly from the application source code (e.g., source code docstring).
This changes may not load automatically and may require a restart to render correctly.

```bash
mkdocs serve
```

### Building HTML Source

The `build` command will compile the application source code and write the resulting HTML files to a local directory called `site`.
Old build files are automatically rmoved before building a new version.

```bash
mkdocs build
```
